### Once, I wrote a F31 for Christmas Trip to Texas

"If I can't write it, at least I can make fun of writing it." How I wrote my my first F31 for a trip to Texas.

<!--more-->

In fall 2017, I was planning a Christmas trip to Texas with a friend from college who was also in a Biomedical Engineering PhD program. At the time, both of us was going through some inevitable challenges in a PhD journey. My friend, J, was busy preparing to pass her dessertation proposal, whereas I was adjusting to a new PhD program in the valley of the sun. We vent to each other over and over again about how painful it is for us, both Chinese, to write in English and write academically. Why do words have to take on different meanings when it comes to academic writing? Why does one word have so many different meannings?

Then, it came the time to make plans for our Texas roadtrip. To mock our own pains in writing, I turned our travel plan into an F31, a common document we need to submit as our dissertation proposal. At the time I thought, if I can't write it, at least I can make fun of writing it. So my first F31-formatted proposal was born.

Looking back at it almost 3 years later, after having submitted my F31 and passed my proposal defense, I am still deeply amused. There are so many bad puns to convey my imposter syndrome, and so many unnecessarily sophisticated sentences to pretend I know how to write. Plus, I definitely did not knew much about an F31. Nonetheless, it did a good job capturing my life and mindset at the time. It was so bad that I am proud of it.

Here it is. At the end of this proposal, you will find some figures that summarize our travel study from this proposal. 

### TITLE: Where Do GePaos Go -- A Travel Proposal

#### PROJECT NARRATIVE
This trip serves as the celebration for J’s successfully defending her dissertation proposal, P’s surviving her first grilling semester, and most important of all, the seven-year friendship between the two GePaos. GePao-ship,defined by awkward greetings followed by overly resentful mutual insults and timely malfunctioning emotional supports, has been grounded on time-wasting TV series, such as The Big Bang Theory [[1]](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), Person of Interest [[2]](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1839578/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), and Young Sheldon [[3]](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6226232/); common long-lasting affection for Jasper Chan [[4]](https://www.instagram.com/jasperchan_/?hl=en); and occasional reminiscences of past traumatizing episodes and individuals whose names PJ neglectfully choose not to mention. 

More seriously, this trip also serves as an iconic movement to symbolize the PhD experiences of PJ. A 2017 article by Levecque et al. highlighted that “one in two PhD students experiences psychological distress” [[5]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048733317300422?via%3Dihub). Empirically, PJs have been proven capable of being that one student, the main factor being constant failures through academic writing practices. Results from an imaginary t-test suggested that readers put in significantly more efforts understanding writings by PJ than PJ themselves put in writing it (p < .00…01). Despite such findings, they continue to write to propose this work because why not — everyone is smart enough to not care for it anyway, like P and J.

#### NONSPECIFIC AIMS
Celebrating winter break through Christmas Travel (CT) remains a major recreational event for students in the pursuit for doctoral degrees, whose daunting job consists of research, publication and making the advisor happy. CT has been proposed to mediate immunity against depression and procrastination with uplifting Christmas music [Apple Music, 2017], and advertisements on holiday deals can also be quite educational [DealMoon, 2017].  During CT, alcohol and nicotine bind with taste buds, creating parallel elevations in appetites and expenses, the latter equalling months of salaries before tax. However, wanna-get-away trips induced by tremendous pressure and anxiety have not resolved the primary psychological challenge that many PhD candidates face -- the imposter syndrome. For this reason, CT must be paired with self-efficacy-improvement treatments to to re-introduce a confident mindset. The Boost My Ego (BME) program developed by BokiTheFart et al. (in held) was argued to be a feasible and effective intervention for PhDs self-diagnosed with imposter syndrome. Therefore, two female PhD patients are recruited for this CT session, Parents have Doubts (patient J) and Potential heavy Drinker (patient P), to test out the BME program in Texas.

_**Aim 1**_: Maximize protein intake and energy consumption.
_**Rejected Hypothesis 1a**_: Premium aged and trimmed steak will suffice protein intake. To prolong time on the road will maximize energy consumption, which is quantified as the weighted average of transportation costs (airfare and mileage) per day. 

_**Aim 2**_: Go on a Christmas-themed road trip while paying tributes to The Big Bang Theory and Person of Interest, because Texas is home to fan favorites Sheldon Cooper and Samantha Grooves.
_**Rejected Hypothesis 2a**_: The aim is not achievable because Sheldon is famously known for hating Christmas, and neither Root and Shaw nor Finch and Reese celebrated Christmas. 
_**Rejected Hypothesis 2b**_: Alternatively, PJ will be wearing red and green, listening to Christmas music as if watching episodes from TBBT and POI. Neither of them will understand a thing without subtitles.

_**Aim 3**_: Recharge for the upcoming semester.
_**Rejected Hypothesis 3a**_: P is marginally close to driving J crazy by turning holiday travel plans into a F31 proposal. Hence after the trip ends, J will be thrilled for normal graduate life to begin again. A secondary outcome for J will be subconscious improvements in nonsense writing.

#### RESEARCH STRATEGY
##### INSIGNIFICANCE
This celebration trip to Texas is insignificant for two reasons. First, the break is crucial for PhD candidates to recall what life is, which they will inevitably fail to encode once school starts. Second, the BME program will provide training that induces enhancements for multiple cognitive domains, namely daydreaming (visuospatial function), bullshitting (executive function), and jaywalking (motor control). 

##### APPROACH
Protection of Human Subjects
Working hazards (laptops, working emails, Dropbox) will be excluded or disabled to control for adverse events. The six-day experimental session features southern comforts, not the alcohol per se, but rather nutrition (TexMex) and luxuries such as queen-size beds.
