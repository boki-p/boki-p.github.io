I study motor skill acquisition. Or how to learn to move with a level of expertise, like playing my favorite sport :basketball:. Our ability to learn these movements is related to visuospatial ability, the cognitive ability to perceive the spatial relations :triangular_ruler: to objects we interact with through vision :eye:. My overall research question is: _"can changes in visuospatial ability affect motor skill acquisition?"_ 

I use neuromodulation to tackle this question. Neuromodulation, by its name, is to modulate neural activity purposefully. _Can we enhance visuospatial function through neuromodulation, and thereby enhance motor skill learning?_ Answering these questions can reveal an opportunity to improve motor learning, which ultimately leads to better performance. 

Below are my recent projects for this research. I am working on developing the contents, but all the titles are out there so that you can get a :eyes: of what I am doing.
